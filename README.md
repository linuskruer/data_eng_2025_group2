**Business Brief**


A large e-commerce marketplace wants to understand how weather patterns in the US East Coast influence online consumer behavior and seller activity. By joining daily weather data with eBay sales listings, the company can analyze seasonal trends, pricing behaviour, and demand shifts under different weather conditions. These insights will help optimize marketing campaigns, inventory management, and pricing strategies across product categories.


1. How do weather conditions (rain, snow, extreme heat/cold) impact the number of product listings posted per day on eBay across the East Coast?


2. Does weather influence pricing behavior? For example, are certain product types (e.g., outdoor gear, electronics, clothing) listed at higher or lower average prices during extreme weather conditions?


3. What is the relationship between weather and shipping choices? Do sellers offer more free shipping or adjust shipping costs depending on bad weather days?


4. Are there noticeable shifts in product category demand under specific weather conditions? (e.g., umbrellas during rainy days, jackets during colder days).


5. Do seller performance metrics (feedback score, percentage) correlate with weather-driven listing activity? For example, do high-feedback sellers dominate the market during adverse weather when casual sellers list less?


6. (Bonus) Does weather impact listing quality (e.g., shorter titles, fewer buying options) due to sellers rushing during poor weather?


7. (Bonus) Which US East Coast zip code prefixes show the largest variation in pricing and product availability with changing weather?
